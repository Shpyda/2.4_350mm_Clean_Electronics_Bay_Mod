# 2.4_350mm_Clean_Electronics_Bay_Mod
This is a modular design meant to clean the electronics bay of the Voron 2.4 350mm. It consists of a main board (divided into 4 quadrants for easier printing) and smaller riser boards that the individual components affix to. This allows for future expansion or changes. I've designed this to use the same heat inserts that are used in the Voron BOM of which 76 are necessary for this build.

This corner channel has a cutout in case you need to route camera, lighting, or any other cable in from up top. There is also a version without the cutout. Both help to prevent pass-thru wiring from getting caught up in the Z belts.

The main board mounts to the same mount points previously used by the DIN rails. One of the mount bolts is positioned underneath where the PSU riser card inserts and there is a hole in the riser card to accommodate this.
