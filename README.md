# 2.4_350mm_Clean_Electronics_Bay_Mod
This is a modular design meant to clean the electronics bay of the Voron 2.4 350mm. It consists of a main board (divided into 4 quadrants for easier printing) and smaller riser boards that the individual components affix to. This allows for future expansion or changes.
